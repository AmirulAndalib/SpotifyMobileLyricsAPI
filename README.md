# Spotify Mobile Lyrics API

This API overrides the Spotify API endpoint used in the Spotify mobile app to fetch lyrics for the currently playing song.

You can use this API in xManager to fetch lyrics without having a Spotify Premium account.

## How it works

1. The Spotify mobile app sends a request to the **Mobile Spotify API** to get the lyrics for the currently playing song.

2. The official **Mobile Spotify API** endpoint is overridden in the app code to point to the **modified API**.

3. The **modified API** fetches the lyrics from the **WEB API** of Spotify, which doesn't require a Premium account.

4. The lyrics are returned in the correct format ([Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/)) to the Spotify mobile app.

5. The mobile app displays the lyrics.

## xManager

### Patch xManager

#### Download the pre-patched releases

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Natoune/SpotifyMobileLyricsAPI/releases) page and download the latest release of Spotify patched with xManager and the Spotify Mobile Lyrics API.

#### Manually patch xManager release (Linux only)

The script `patch_xmanager.sh` will automatically download the latest release of xManager-patched Spotify and apply the Spotify Mobile Lyrics API patch.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Natoune/SpotifyMobileLyricsAPI/main/patch_xmanager.sh
chmod +x patch_xmanager.sh
./patch_xmanager.sh -server "lyrics.natanchiodi.fr" -name "Natan Chiodi" -apk "Spotify v8.8.74.652 [xManager] (Merged).apk"
```

Script arguments:

- `-server` the lyrics API host (see [Public servers list](#public-servers-list)).
- `-name` the name used to sign the patched APK.
- `-apk` the path to the xManager-patched Spotify APK. If not provided, the script will download the latest release (user input required).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please host your own instance of the lyrics API if you can. My server is not meant to handle a lot of traffic. If you want to share your server, please open a pull request to add it to the public servers list.
